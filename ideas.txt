ideas and todo:
- low poly torus as icon
- implement pwa
- contact email or some page 

nice to have: 
- feedback for initial scramble
- make circular reveal nicer, fade in
- scale labels by their size, so they always fit
- wait until all icons and images are loaded before showing them
- try to take up maximum space, by rearranging layout, for example when phone is 
in landscape mode, move the controls and settings of to the sides
- multi touch
- highscores
- auto-solve

done:
- prevent multitouch (Y)
- feedback for when puzzle is completely solved, 
wave animation, green border, green text (Y)
- contact and inspiration footer (Y)
- persist config and gamestate (Y)
- rotate settings icon when clicked (Y)
- prevent overflow of timer, scale it down if too big (didn't scale it down, but position=absolute should suffice) (Y)
- circular rows (Y)
- gradient-image rendering when dimension do not fit yet (after recalculate) (Y)
- timer, number of moves (Y)
- functioning, well layout settings (Y)
- pause when inactive (window inactive) (Y)
- responsive, nice layout (Y)
